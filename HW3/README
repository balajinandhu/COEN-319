HW #
1. You can change the number of rows and columns by changing the NROWS and NCOLUMNS constants.
Compile using:
g++ -Wall -fopenmp Hw3_1.cpp

The program outputs the running time of sequential and parallel data computation.
The program outputs 'No Match' if the outputs don't match.

2.You can change the number of elements in the array by changing the NROWS constant. 
Compile using:
g++ -Wall -fopenmp Hw3_2.cpp
 
The program outputs the running time of sequential and parallel insertion sort.
Since Insertion sort is inherently serial, we use a combination of shell sort and insertion sort to achieve parallelism.
The program outputs 'No Match' if the outputs don't match.

3.You can change the width of tile by changing the TILE_WIDTH constant. The size of A and B are 1000*10000 and 10000*1000.

Compilation steps:
$ setup cuda
$ nvcc Hw3_3.cu -o Hw3_3
$ ./Hw3_3

The program outputs the running time of sequential and parallel matrix multiplication.
The program outputs 'No Match' if the outputs don't match.
